# Get Started

# Micro-services
<p>
  Microservices, in simple terms, are a way of designing and building software applications as a collection of small, independent, and specialized components that work together to provide a complete service or application. Imagine these components as tiny, self-contained building blocks that can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

Each microservice is responsible for a specific function or feature of the application, such as handling user authentication, processing payments, or managing user profiles. These individual microservices communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces or APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).
</p>

# Why 
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>
  it's easier to handle increased demand for specific functionalities without affecting the entire application
</p>
<h3>Flexibility</h3>
<p>
  Different teams can work on different microservices simultaneously, using different technologies and programming languages if needed
</p>
<h3>Fault Isolation</h3>
<p>
 If one microservice fails, it doesn't necessarily bring down the whole application. The impact is limited to that specific functionality.
</p>
<h3>Innovation and Speed</h3>
<p>
 Teams can develop and deploy new features independently, allowing for faster innovation.

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      Micro-services are run as separate process
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Consequently, we have to setup a separate project/repo  for each services  and configure  a xlient  for any  process that would  like  to use  the services

</ul>
